# plt2geojson ðŸŒŽ

#### Convert [Compass](https://fountainware.com/compass/) plot files into [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/). Particularly handy if you need to render a Compass based cave survey in [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Usage (cli)

Open your Survey in Compass and click the `Process and View Cave` button to generate a `.plt` file. Compass will place this file next to the project `.mak` and the `.dat` file(s).

Run plot2geojson by passing the `.plt` file to reproduce the plot as GeoJSON:

`npx plt2geojson /path/to/your/plot.plt`

**Options:**
```
cli.js <input>

Convert PLT to GeoJSON

Positionals:
  input  Input Compass PLT file                                         [string]

Options:
      --help     Show help                                             [boolean]
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -a, --analyze  Analyze the Compass file instead of converting it to GeoJSON
                                                                       [boolean]
  -p, --pretty   Render the GeoJSON with more visually appealing polygons
                                                                       [boolean]
  -l, --line     Render the GeoJSON with a line connecting each station[boolean]
```

## Usage (lib)

```
import plt2geojson from 'plt2geojson';

plt2geojson(plotFile: string, options?: RenderOptions): string;
```

**RenderOptions**
```
type RenderOptions = {
    // Render the GeoJSON with more visually appealing polygons
    pretty: boolean;
    // Render the GeoJSON with a line connecting each station
    line: boolean;
};
```

## GeoJSON structure

Each set of stations is used to reproduce a polygon consisting of the left and right walls. The _forward_ station (per Compass standards) in the polygon dictates the properties associated with the polygon. Station properties look like:

```
{
    name: string;
    elevation: number;
    penetration: number;
    comment: string;
    flags: {
        ExcludeClosure: boolean;
        ExcludeLength: boolean;
        Splay: boolean;
    }
}
```
